# FileStorageRewards Smart Contract

## Vision

The **FileStorageRewards** smart contract incentivizes users to share their unused storage space by offering token-based rewards. This decentralized system promotes efficient utilization of storage resources, providing a reward mechanism for users who contribute to the network.

## Features

- **Register Storage**:
  - Storage providers can register their unused storage space, specifying the amount available for sharing.
- **Reward Providers**:
  - Storage providers are rewarded with tokens once they have shared their storage space.

## Future Scope

1. **Automated Reward Distribution**:

   - Implement an automated reward system based on actual storage usage or time-based contributions.

2. **Dynamic Storage Pricing**:

   - Introduce a dynamic pricing model for storage space, allowing providers to set competitive rates.

3. **Storage Verification**:
   - Add a mechanism to verify that the registered storage is actively used before issuing rewards.

The **FileStorageRewards** contract promotes decentralized storage sharing by incentivizing users with token rewards, fostering a sustainable and efficient file storage ecosystem.
